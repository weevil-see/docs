**Welcome to the community documentation for the weevil project on TaxonWorks!**

This documentation is not meant to replace the official [TaxonWorks Guide](https://docs.taxonworks.org/guide/).
It is meant to make your start with the software as _smooth_ as possible, going step by step and focusing on the most important aspects first.  
There are many other resources to find information, but we think that it could be overwhelming for a newcomer, as there are tons of features implemented in TaxonWorks.

**Also, we'll use this site to document our specific workflows, to make sure our data is consistent.**
