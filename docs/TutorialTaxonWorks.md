## Why TaxonWorks?
(To be added soon)

More information can be found in [About the Tutorial](TutorialAbout.md).
## Cards: Tasks and Data
The tools of TaxonWorks are organized in cards: Task cards and Data cards.  
You can scroll through cards using the arrow buttons for right and left. You can also search for text (name and description) or sort them by category.  
In this video, I'm searching for the "**New Taxon Name**" Task and add it as a favorite for quick access.

Don't be overwhelmed by the large number of cards. Most of them are the solution for very specific problems, and you'll probably need to use only a handful of them.
