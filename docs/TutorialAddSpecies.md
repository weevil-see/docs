# New Taxon Name
To add taxon names and synonymy, we use the "New taxon name" task.  
Start by adding the species epithet in the "name" field.  
**Important:** You should enter the species name with the same grammatical ending as in its **original combination** (= [protonym](https://docs.taxonworks.org/about/glossary.html#protonym) in TaxonWorks wording). TaxonWork will adjust the ending for each subsequent combination:  
A species that was described as _Cleonus obsoletefaciatus_ (_Cleonus_ is gramatically male) will automatically become "_obsoletefasciata_" when combined with the genus name _Asproparthenis_ (grammatically female).  

**In the "Parent" field, you select the parent taxon where YOU want to place the taxon**. The original combination, as well as other subsequent combinations, will be added later! For species, the parent could be either a genus or a subgenus. Try to be as specific as possible.
