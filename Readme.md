# How to edit the documentation:
The pages are just markdown files (.md) in the /docs directory. You can edit them directly on GitHub. Place images in the /assets/images directory and embed them in the markdown file as seen in the existing files.  
Github Actions will deploy the website after you save changes.  
To adjust the order and structure of the pages, adjust nav in the zensical.toml file.  
For more information, refer to the authoring tutorial on the zensical documentation: https://zensical.org/docs/authoring/markdown/

# Troubleshooting
If files where changed but the website is still the same (changes should be visible within 1 minute), delete the "site" folder. It is re-generated by zensical from the source md files and can be deleted without hesitation.
