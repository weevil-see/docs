Therefore, the data was arranged in a verbatim format optimized for human readability.</p> Entry for a genus in the original Cleonini Catalogue. Below, not covered by the screenshot, are the full references for each citation. <p>In this image, we see a lot of information that needs to be transferred into TaxonWorks:</p> <ul> <li>Names for genus, subgenus and species, including synonyms. Synonyms can have a status e.g. as homonym</li> <li>Citation for original description, with page number</li> <li>Images, usually depicting a type specimen</li> <li>Original genus for names that where described in a different genus</li> <li>Type locality, sometimes in verbatim (\"Steppes des Kirguises\")</li> <li>Asserted distribution: List of countries/provinces from which the species was recorded, with citation. </li> <li>Type seen by Massimo Meregalli (\"!\")</li> <li>Verbatim text (\"Remarks: A lectotype [...]\")</li> </ul> <p>All of this is extremely valuable information and easily represented in the data model of TaxonWorks.

Start by adding the species epithet in the \"name\" field. Important: You should enter the species name with the same grammatical ending as in its original combination (= protonym in TaxonWorks wording). TaxonWork will adjust the ending for each subsequent combination: A species that was described as Cleonus obsoletefaciatus (Cleonus is gramatically male) will automatically become \"obsoletefasciata\" when combined with the genus name Asproparthenis (grammatically female).  </p> <p>In the \"Parent\" field, you select the parent taxon where YOU want to place the taxon. The original combination, as well as other subsequent combinations, will be added later! For species, the parent could be either a genus or a subgenus.
