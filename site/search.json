It is an excellent example of a richly annotated catalog, many other catalogs contain fewer citations for the information they provide. However, it would profit from living in a database such as TaxonWorks, where the data is much more manageable, interlinked and filterable.</p> Entry for a genus in the original Cleonini Catalogue. It also contains the full references for each citation, not included in the screenshot. <p>We see a lot of information that needs to be transferred into TaxonWorks:</p> <ul> <li>Names for genus, subgenus and species, including synonyms. Synonyms can have a status e.g. as homonym</li> <li>Citation for original description, with page number</li> <li>Images, usually depicting a type specimen</li> <li>Original genus for names that where described in a different genus</li> <li>Type locality, sometimes in verbatim (\"Steppes des Kirguises\")</li> <li>Asserted distribution: List of countries/provinces from which the species was recorded, with citation. </li> <li>Type seen by Massimo Meregalli (\"!\")</li> <li>Verbatim text (\"Remarks: A lectotype [...]\")</li> </ul> <p>All of this is extremely valuable information and easily represented in the data model of TaxonWorks.

After adding the source, add the page number(s). When entering species names from a list, it's good practice to check the source to verify the original spelling of the name as well as the page number. If the source is lacking a DOI or Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) link, you should add it. To edit the source, you can quickly open it in the \"New Source\" task from the radial navigator (the circle with the pointer, see video). Open the link in a new tab for convenience. The author of the source is not necessarily the author of the species name: In most cases, you can go to the \"Person\" tab and clone the author from the source.

The database can contain bare OTUs without a taxon name and vice versa, mainly from imports.

Don't worry, this looks very complicated but in TaxonWorks it isnt!</p> Information, such as distribution, can be added to the OTU of a synonymized name. This allows to retain information for synonymized names, but TaxonWork will summarize everything for you. This figure is probably very inaccurate, it's just to give an idea.
